Project details: You have just been hired by a Web agency, the WebAgency, which produces websites for different clients. 
However, they themselves recognize that their current site is aging because they have little time to work on it. 
Admittedly, it seems that the shoemakers are the most poorly fitted, but all the same ... 
We therefore suggest that, for your first mission, you take care of the redesign of the agency's site. 
The site must fit on a page with a menu that remains visible, at the top of the page, even when moving around the page. 
The different sections expected are: 
1- A first welcome welcome screen, very visual 
2- The list of services offered by the agency 
3- Examples of projects already carried out 
4- A card with a contact form (no not ask you to run the form, just display it.)
